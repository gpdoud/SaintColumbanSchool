# Chromebook won't boot

## ISSUE

## RESOLUTION

If your Chromebook won’t boot, first attempt a hard reset: press and hold the Power button for 30 seconds, then release and try turning it on normally. If that fails, try rebooting with recovery keys by holding Esc + Refresh (🔄) + Power, then releasing all keys after the recovery screen appears.

If the device shows a "Chrome OS is missing or damaged" error, you may need to reinstall Chrome OS using a USB recovery drive. Create one on another computer with the Chromebook Recovery Utility app, then follow on-screen recovery instructions.

Check for signs of battery issues—no lights, no fan noise—by plugging in the charger for at least 30 minutes before retrying. If nothing happens, the battery may be depleted or the hardware faulty.

For further diagnostics, use the Get Help app (if accessible) or submit feedback via Alt + Shift + i.
