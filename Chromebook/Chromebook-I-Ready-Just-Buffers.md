# Chomebook I-Ready Just Buffers

## ISSUE

Sometime, I-Ready does not allow a student to get to their Reading or Math assignment. 

Sometimes, there are three rotating blue dots and never stops.

Other times, the Loading green button never loads fully.

## RESOLUTION

For the rotating blue dots:

1) Power the Chromebook down then start it up.
2) Have the child login
3) Check if the Reading or Math assignment will start correctly

For the green button not finishing loading:

1) If the Google browser has multiple tab, have the child shut down all the tabs not needed for the assignment.
2) Try again to load the Reading or Math assignment.
3) If #2 doesn't work, power off the Chromebook then power it back on
4) Retry loding the Reading or Math assignment
