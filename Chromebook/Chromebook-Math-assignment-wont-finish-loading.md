# Chromebook math assignment won't load completely

# ISSUE

A first grader brought his Chromebook and said he and most of the other students in the classroom could not get a math problem to load completely. He said his teacher would like to have someone come to her classroom.

Even after restarting the Chromebook, the math problem would not load completely. The math problem is a tab in the browser. The first grader had about 25 tabs open. I suggested trying to shut down all the tabs and retry starting the math problem.

# RESOLUTION

The problem was resolved when most of the browser tabs were shutdown. All the open tabs seemed to overload the Chromebook. It is probably a good idea to have children with Chromebooks shut down anything running that is not needed for the assignment.
