# Windows laptop has no Internet

## ISSUE

A user, who had Internet yesterday, cannot access the Internet.

## RESOLUTION

Check the Internet at the lower right of the screen. It would look like a globe if there is no Internet versus a quarter of a pie if it is connected to the internet. If the globe is displayed, click on it and a list of wifi access should display.

Select the `StCS-Staff` and click the Connect button. Then enter the password to that wifi.
