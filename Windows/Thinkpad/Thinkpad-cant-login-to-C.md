# Can't login to C (whatever that is)

## ISSUE

A student said he could not sign in unless he reset his password. But ever after restting it, using the reset password didn't work also.

## RESPONSE

We restarted the laptop and used an admin account to sign in. Checking for Windows Updated, found a security item that was to be updated. After the update was done, we restarted the laptop again and had the student sign in. The C app displayed fir the first time that new passwords required the following:

    1 lower case letter
    1 upper case letter
    1 number
    1 symbol #!@

When the student created a new password that contained the four character types, the login of C worked fine.
