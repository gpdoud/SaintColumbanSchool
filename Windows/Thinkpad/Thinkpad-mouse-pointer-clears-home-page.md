# Thinkpad mouse pointer clears home page

## ISSUE

A student, after signing into the laptop, displays a large mouse pointer and some of the home page is erased as the mouse is moved around the home page. Applying all the windows updated didn't seem to correct the issue.

I sent an email to Xerox asking if there was any problem doing a reset of the laptop. I'm waiting for a response.
