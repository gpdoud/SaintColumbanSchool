# Thinkpad display is blank

## ISSUE

A student had a laptop that seemed to be running (I could hear the fans), but the display displayed nothing. Charging didn't help and neither did powering it off then back on.

## RESOLUTION

To resolve the issue, remove the charger. Then, depress and hold the power button until the fans stop running and all the keyboard lights go out. Then plug the charger back in and press and release the power button and the laptop started normally.
