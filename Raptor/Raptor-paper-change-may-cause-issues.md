# Raptor may have problems when changing paper

## ISSUE

When the paper in the printer runs out, if a change is attempted without powering off the printer, there may be a problem which may require some admin support to reset the system correctly.

## RESOLUTION

The correct way to change the paper in the printer is to power off the printer. Then put the new paper in the printer, then power up the printer. This should work without problems.
